# Build and locally run web app

In order to run the web app locally, follow these steps.

You can either use vscode to help with this, or just through the standard terminal.


Getting the code by cloning through VSCode:
1. Open a new VSCode window so that you see the start page. 
2. Locate and click the 'Clone Git Repository' link on the page
3. Paste in the url of the repository, that being https://github.com/COS420-Fall23/The-A-Team
4. You can either open in current window or in new, it doesn't matter
5. Open a new terminal in VSCode by clicking the top three-line menu > Terminal > New Terminal
6. run the command 'cd App'
7. Continue to the section of install commands.


Getting the code using a terminal:

Change the directory to any preferred location where you want to locally store the code, then procede to run the following commands
~~~
git clone https://github.com/COS420-Fall23/The-A-Team
cd The-A-Team/App/
~~~

Building the code and running locally:

Run the following commands in the terminal in the folder The-A-Team
~~~
npm install
npm run start
~~~

You usually only ever need to run npm install once, and just use 
~~~
npm run start
~~~
whenever you want to run the web app.
However, a dependency was added on 10-22-2023, so you will need to re-run the 'npm install' command if you last installed before that date.

Your web browser should now open, and you may even get a pop-up for firewall settings.
You should now see the web app on your screen.

# Team Communication Policy

### 1. Discord Timeliness:

Replies to general questions or discussions on Discord should be made within 24 hours. If the message is sent outside of working hours, a reply by the end of the next working day is expected. For urgent matters, use direct messaging, or if needed, reach out by text messaging for immediate contact.


### 2. Using @everyone on Discord:

The `@everyone` tag should only be used for urgent announcements, significant updates, or when there's a need for input from all team members. Remember, overuse can lead to desensitization.


### 3. Response to Questions on Discord:

If a question is posed and you know the answer or can contribute to the solution, please reply. Silence isn't golden here. If you're not entirely sure but want to give it a shot, indicate your uncertainty but share your thoughts. If someone else has already provided a complete and correct answer, there's no need for repetition unless you have a unique perspective to add.


### 4. Communication Mediums for Specific Purposes:

Text/SMS: Reserved for urgent matters or quick updates.
Phone Calls: For in-depth, immediate discussions or emergencies.
Zoom: For the agreed-upon synchronous working slots, and various scrums/meetings throughout the week.
JetBrains Spaces: For project management, task allocation, and tracking.
Google Drive: For document creation and sharing.
