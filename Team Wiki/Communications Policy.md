# Communication Policy

### 1. Discord Timeliness:

Replies to general questions or discussions on Discord should be made within 24 hours. If the message is sent outside of working hours, a reply by the end of the next working day is expected. For urgent matters, use direct messaging.


### 2. Using @everyone on Discord:

The `@everyone` tag should only be used for urgent announcements, significant updates, or when there's a need for input from all team members. Remember, overuse can lead to desensitization.


### 3. Response to Questions on Discord:

If a question is posed and you know the answer or can contribute to the solution, please reply. Silence isn't golden here. If you're not entirely sure but want to give it a shot, indicate your uncertainty but share your thoughts. If someone else has already provided a complete and correct answer, there's no need for repetition unless you have a unique perspective to add.


### 4. Communication Mediums for Specific Purposes:

Text/SMS: Reserved for urgent matters or quick updates.
Phone Calls: For in-depth, immediate discussions or emergencies.
Zoom: For the agreed-upon 30-minute synchronous working slots.
JetBrains Spaces: For project management, task allocation, tracking, and document sharing.
